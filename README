This program calculates orbital effects for a system with an arbitrary number of bodies.  Call from the lib folder with 'ruby run_orbits.rb'.  run_orbits.rb is where the system is set up: add as many bodies as you want with Free_body.new(), while inputing mass, x, y, vel_x, vel_y, acc_x, and acc_y (they all have defaults, but you should give positions and velocities to make it interesting).  You can also change how many iterations are done.  Lastly, just put each body into the all_bodies array, save, and run.  The output positions are printed to move_tracker.txt, where each line is a tab separated list of x and y coordinates for each body (i.e. 'body1.x\tbody1.y\tbody2.x\tbody2.y...\n').  You can easily plot the data with, for instance gnuplot, using:
"plot 'move_tracker.txt' using 1:2 wi li, 'move_tracker.txt' using 3:4 wi li..." for all bodies.

Side note: you can (and should, just for fun) change the gravitational constant and time constant in orbiter.rb, but it will break the tests, which expect both to be 1.
